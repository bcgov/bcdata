# DataBC Services used by `bcdata`

This document is an attempt at a comprehensive list of services and API endpoints accessed by the bcdata R package, as well which return values we rely on from those endpoints.

## BC Data Catalogue

### API version: 
  - PROD: `https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/api/3`
  - BETA: `https://beta-catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/api/3`

### Endpoints:
  - `/action/package_show`
  - `/action/package_search`
    - `license_id`
    - `download_audience`
    - `res_format`

        (This is not always the same as the `typeNames` parameter in `resource.url`, as that is sometimes a simplified view - eg., `WHSE_ADMIN_BOUNDARIES.ADM_NR_DISTRICTS_SPG` vs 
`WHSE_ADMIN_BOUNDARIES.ADM_NR_DISTRICTS_SP`)
    - `details`
      - `column_comments`
      - `column_name`
    - `bcdc_type` (not actually using yet but [may be useful](https://github.com/bcgov/bcdata/pull/283#issuecomment-924442166))

  Query Parameters for `geo/pub/wfs`:
  
  - query is sent in the body of a `POST` request (with `encode = "form"`). If a dataset has > n records (default n = 1000), pagination is used to send sequential requests. Pagination is executed using `count`, `sortBY`, and `startIndex`.

    - REQUEST = "GetCapabilities"
    - REQUEST = "GetFeature"
      - outputFormat = "application/json"

      - SRSNAME (default `EPSG:3005`)
      - CQL_FILTER
      - count
