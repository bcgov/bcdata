The `bcdata` [R](https://www.r-project.org/) package contains functions for searching & retrieving data from the [B.C. Data Catalogue]( https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca).

The [B.C. Data Catalogue](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=79B5224167334667A44C9E8B5143D0C5) is the place to find British Columbia Government data, applications and web services. Much of the data are released under the [Open Government Licence --- British Columbia](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/data/open-data/open-government-licence-bc), as well as numerous other [licences](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset?download_audience=Public).



You can install `bcdata` directly from CRAN:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("bcdata")

library(bcdata)
```

### `bcdc_browse()`

`bcdata::bcdc_browse()` let's you access the [B.C. Data Catalogue web interface](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca) directly from R---opening the catalogue search page in your default browser:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## Take me to the B.C. Data Catalogue home page
bcdc_browse()
```

If you know the catalogue "human-readable" record name or permanent ID you can open directly to the record web page:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## Take me to the B.C. Winery Locations catalogue record using the record name
bcdc_browse("bc-winery-locations")

## Take me to the B.C. Winery Locations catalogue record using the record permanent ID
bcdc_browse("1d21922b-ec4f-42e5-8f6b-bf320a286157")
```

### `bcdc_search()`

`bcdc_search()` let's you search records in the B.C. Data Catalogue, returning the search results in your R session.

Let's search the catalogue for records that contain the word "recycling":

```{r}
## Give me the catalogue search results for 'recycling'
bcdc_search("recycling")
```

You can set the number of records to be returned from the search and/or you can customize your search using the catalogue search _facets_ `license_id`, `download_audience`, `type`, `res_format`, `sector`, and `organization`:

```{r}
## Give me the first catalogue search result for 'recycling'
bcdc_search("recycling", n = 1)

## Give me the catalogue search results for 'recycling' where the
## data is tabular and licenced under Open Government Licence – British Columbia
bcdc_search("recycling", type = "Dataset", license_id = "2")
```

You can see all valid values for the catalogue search facets using `bcdata::bcdc_search_facets()`:

```{r}
## Valid values for search facet 'license_id'
bcdc_search_facets(facet = "license_id")
```

Finally, you can retrieve the _metadata_ for a single catalogue record by using the record name or permanent ID with `bcdc_get_record()`. It is advised to use the permanent ID rather than the human-readable name in non-interactive situations---like scripts---to guard against future name changes of a record:

```{r}
## Give me the catalogue record metadata for `bc-first-tire-recycling-data-1991-2006`
bcdc_get_record("a29ad492-29a2-44b9-8693-d27a8cc8e686")
```

### `bcdc_get_data()`

Once you have located the B.C. Data Catalogue record with the data you want, you can use `bcdata::bcdc_get_data()` to download and read the data from the record.  You can use the record name, permanent ID or the result from `bcdc_get_record()`. Let's look at the B.C. Highway Web Cameras data:

```{r}
## Get the data resource for the `bc-highway-cams` catalogue record
bcdc_get_data("bc-highway-cams")

## OR use the permanent ID, which is better for scripts or non-interactive use
bcdc_get_data("6b39a910-6c77-476f-ac96-7b4f18849b1c")

## OR use the result from bcdc_get_record()
my_record <- bcdc_get_record("6b39a910-6c77-476f-ac96-7b4f18849b1c")
bcdc_get_data(my_record)
```

A catalogue record can have one or multiple data files---or "resources". If there is only one resource, `bcdc_get_data()` will return that resource by default, as in the above `bc-highway-cams` example. If there are multiple data resources you will need to specify which resource you want. Let's look at a catalogue record that contains multiple data resources---BC Schools - Programs Offered in Schools:

```{r}
## Get the record ID for the `bc-schools-programs-offered-in-schools` catalogue record
bcdc_search("school programs", n = 1)

## Get the metadata for the `bc-schools-programs-offered-in-schools` catalogue record
bcdc_get_record("b1f27d1c-244a-410e-a361-931fac62a524")
```

We see there are two data files or resources available in this record, so we need to tell `bcdc_get_data()` which one we want. When used interactively, `bcdc_get_data()` will prompt you with the list of available resources through `bcdata` and ask you to select the resource you want. The resource ID for each data set is available _in_ the metadata record ☝️:

```{r}
## Get the txt data resource from the `bc-schools-programs-offered-in-schools`
## catalogue record
bcdc_get_data("b1f27d1c-244a-410e-a361-931fac62a524", resource = 'a393f8cf-51ec-42c6-8449-4cea4c75385c')
```

Alternatively, you can retrieve the full details of the available resources for a given record as a data frame using `bcdc_tidy_resources():

```{r}
## Get a data frame of data resources for the `bc-schools-programs-offered-in-schools`
## catalogue record
bcdc_tidy_resources("b1f27d1c-244a-410e-a361-931fac62a524")
```

`bcdc_get_data()` will also detect if the data resource is a geospatial file, and automatically reads and returns it as an [`sf` object](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) in your R session.

Let's get the air zones for British Columbia:

```{r air_zones, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 7}
## Find the B.C. Air Zones catalogue record
bcdc_search("air zones", res_format = "geojson")

## Get the metadata for the B.C. Air Zones catalogue record
bc_az_metadata <- bcdc_get_record("e8eeefc4-2826-47bc-8430-85703d328516")

## Get the B.C. Air Zone geospatial data
bc_az <- bcdc_get_data(bc_az_metadata, resource = "c495d082-b586-4df0-9e06-bd6b66a8acd9")

## Plot the B.C. Air Zone geospatial data with ggplot()
bc_az %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf()
```

**Using B.C. Geographic Warehouse (BCGW) layer names**

If you are familiar with the [B.C. Geographic Warehouse (BCGW)](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/data/geographic-data-services/bc-spatial-data-infrastructure/bc-geographic-warehouse),
you may already know the name of a layer that you want from the BCGW.
`bcdc_get_data()` supports supplying that name directly. For example, the
[record for the B.C. airports layer](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/bc-airports#object-description)
shows that the object name is `WHSE_IMAGERY_AND_BASE_MAPS.GSR_AIRPORTS_SVW`, and
we can use that in `bcdc_get_data()`:

```{r}
bcdc_get_data("WHSE_IMAGERY_AND_BASE_MAPS.GSR_AIRPORTS_SVW")
```

**Note:** The `bcdata` package supports downloading _most_ file types, including zip archives. It will do its best to identify and read data from
zip files, however if there are multiple data files in the zip, or data files that `bcdata` doesn't know how to import, it will fail.

### `bcdc_query_geodata()`

Many geospatial data sets in the B.C. Data Catalogue are available through a [Web Service](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=95D78D544B244F34B89223EF069DF74E). While `bcdc_get_data()` will retrieve the geospatial data for you, sometimes the geospatial file is very large---and slow to download---and/or you may only want _some_ of the data. `bcdc_query_geodata()` let's you query catalogue geospatial data available as Web Service using `select` and `filter` functions (just like in [`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/). The `bcdc::collect()` function returns the `bcdc_query_geodata()` query results as an [`sf` object](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) in your R session.

Let's get the Capital Regional District boundary from the [B.C. Regional Districts geospatial data](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/d1aff64e-dbfe-45a6-af97-582b7f6418b9)---the whole file takes 30-60 seconds to download and I only need the one polygon, so why not save some time:

```{r regional_districts, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 7}
## Find the B.C. Regional Districts catalogue record
bcdc_search("regional districts administrative areas", res_format = "wms", n = 1)

## Get the metadata for the B.C. Regional Districts catalogue record
bc_regional_districts_metadata <- bcdc_get_record("d1aff64e-dbfe-45a6-af97-582b7f6418b9")

## Have a quick look at the geospatial columns to help with filter or select
bcdc_describe_feature(bc_regional_districts_metadata)

## Get the Capital Regional District polygon from the B.C. Regional
## Districts geospatial data
my_regional_district <- bcdc_query_geodata(bc_regional_districts_metadata) %>%
  filter(ADMIN_AREA_NAME == "Capital Regional District") %>%
  collect()

## Plot the Capital Regional District polygon with ggplot()
my_regional_district  %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf()
```

The vignette [Querying Spatial Data with bcdata](https://bcgov.github.io/bcdata/articles/efficiently-query-spatial-data-in-the-bc-data-catalogue.html) provides a full demonstration on how to use `bcdata::bcdc_query_geodata()` to fine tune a [Web Service](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=95D78D544B244F34B89223EF069DF74E) request for geospatial data from the B.C. Data Catalogue.
