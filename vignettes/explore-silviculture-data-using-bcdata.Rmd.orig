This vignette will demonstrate how you can use `bcdata` to access and explore British Columbia silviculture data.

Silviculture data for British Columbia are largely collected and stored through the [Reporting Silviculture Updates and Land Status Tracking System (RESULTS) database](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=F62992DA5B324446AD5E1B5BFFA404CC)---including information on the management of openings, disturbances, silviculture activities and obligation declarations as required by the [Forest and Range Practices Act](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=D65006C0326B4E0F838194044C10CA86). [RESULTS data sets are publically available through the B.C. Data Catalogue](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset?q=RESULTS+silviculture) under the [Open Government Licence - British Columbia](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=A519A56BC2BF44E4A008B33FCF527F61).


## A Silviculture Data Exploration&mdash;Reforestation with Climate Considerations

[Western larch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larix_occidentalis) has been identified as a tree species that will be well-adapted to projected future climates in northern British Columbia.  In 2013, forest policy was developed that allowed foresters to plant western larch outside of its natural range as a climate change adaptation silviculture measure. 

**How much western larch has been planted in the Prince George Natural Resource District?**  

Let's use the `bcdata` package to search, retrieve and explore the RESULTS silviculture data and answer this question. 


### Getting Started

To start, let's load the `bcdata` package. We will also load the `dplyr` and `ggplot2` packages to help us work with the data. You can learn more about the `dplyr` package [here](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) and the `ggplot2` package [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/):

```{r libs, eval = FALSE}
library(bcdata)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```


### Getting the Data

We can gather the data we need to answer our question using the [RESULTS - silviculture forest cover dataset](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/258bb088-4113-47b1-b568-ce20bd64e3e3). First, let's take a look at the metadata record using `bcdc_get_record()`:

```{r get-record}
# Get the metadata using the human-readable record name
bcdc_get_record("results-forest-cover-silviculture")
```

We see that this is a [Web Service-enabled](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=95D78D544B244F34B89223EF069DF74E) geospatial data set&mdash;the list of data resources includes `WMS getCapabilities request`&mdash;so we can query and retrieve this geospatial data set using `bcdc_query_geodata()`:

```{r examine-silv-layer}
# Query the data using the permanent ID of the record to guard against name changes
bcdc_query_geodata("258bb088-4113-47b1-b568-ce20bd64e3e3")
```

This query shows that this data set has over 850,000 features and over 150 fields.  Each feature is a treatment unit within a harvested opening, and contains information on the leading five tree species that are present in each treatment unit, including stems per hectare, age, and height.

Note that we have only _queried_ the data set so far---the data set would be too large (~1GB) to download efficiently.  So, let's use `filter()` with `bcdc_query_geodata()` to refine our query _before_ we collect the data and import it into R.


### Refining a Geospatial Data Query


To address our question, we need the treatment data (1) from the Prince George Natural Resource District _and_ (2) that contain western larch.

First, we can use the `bcdata` package to preview and then download the spatial boundary for the Prince George Natural Resource District. We can use `bcdc_preview()` to interactively view a very simple preview of a [Web Service-enabled](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=95D78D544B244F34B89223EF069DF74E) geospatial data set from the B.C. Data Catalogue. This is useful to quickly verify that the spatial data is what we are looking for:

```{r preview}
bcdc_preview("natural-resource-nr-district")
```


Now we can use `DPG`, the `ORG_UNIT` for Prince George Natural Resource District, to filter and download the spatial boundary we need:

```{r download-dpg}
## Create a spatial feature object named dpg
dpg <- bcdc_query_geodata("natural-resource-nr-district") %>%  
  filter(ORG_UNIT=="DPG") %>% # filter for Prince George Natural Resource District
  collect() # and collect the data
```

Let's plot this spatial object and double check we have we what we need:

```{r plot-dpg}
dpg %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf()
```

Now we have a spatial object that we can use as a bounding box to filter and download records in the RESULTS - silviculture layer from the Prince George Natural Resource District. 

We only need to download the treatments that have western larch planted. We can use the `bcdc_describe_feature()` helper function to examine the column names and types of the layer. In this case, we want to keep rows where the five `S_SPECIES_CODE_*` columns contain `"LW"`, the code for western larch.

```{r load-lw-data, cache = TRUE}
# Make a vector of tree species we are interested in 
# (in this case only LW for western larch)
spp_list = c("LW")
 
# Query and filter the data layer
trees_dpg <-
  bcdc_query_geodata("258bb088-4113-47b1-b568-ce20bd64e3e3") %>%
  filter(INTERSECTS(dpg)) %>% #filter for records that are within the DPG boundary
  filter(
      S_SPECIES_CODE_1 %in% spp_list |  #filter for LW records 
      S_SPECIES_CODE_2 %in% spp_list |
      S_SPECIES_CODE_3 %in% spp_list |
      S_SPECIES_CODE_4 %in% spp_list |
      S_SPECIES_CODE_5 %in% spp_list
  ) %>% 
  collect() #collect/download the data
```


### Exploring the Data

Let's look at the dimensions of this now much more manageable data object we have downloaded from the B.C. Data Catalogue:

```{r dim-data}
dim(trees_dpg)
```

We can see there are `r dim(trees_dpg)[1]` treatment units planted with western larch, and we can make a quick map of these harvested openings for the Prince George Natural Resource District:

```{r map-larch-plantations-dpg, message = FALSE}
trees_dpg %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_sf() + 
  geom_sf(data = dpg, fill = NA) + #add the DPG spatial boundary
  theme_minimal()
```


We can also create some quick descriptive summaries of the data, treating the geospatial attribute table as a data frame in R, and answer our original question---how much western larch has been planted in the Prince George Natural Resource District?


#### What is the size and age distribution of larch plantations in the Prince George Natural Resource District in the year 2020?

```{r, warning = FALSE}
trees_dpg %>% 
  mutate(age = 2020 - REFERENCE_YEAR + S_SPECIES_AGE_1) %>% #create a plantation age column
  ggplot() +  #start a plot
  aes(x = age, y = FEATURE_AREA_SQM/10000) + #convert feature area to hectares
  geom_bar(stat = "sum") +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Stand Age (years)",
                     limits = c(2, 30),
                     breaks = seq(from = 5, to = 30, by = 5)) +
  labs(y = "Sum Treatment Unit Area (ha)",
       title = "Area Planted with Western Larch by Stand Age\nin Prince George Natural Resource District",
       caption = paste0("Data sourced from the B.C. Data Catalogue\n on ",
                        Sys.Date(),
                        " using the bcdata R package")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

#### What is the Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification (BEC) distribution of western larch plantations in the Prince George Natural Resource District?

We can download [British Columbia biogeoclimatic (BEC) data](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/bec-map) from the B.C. Data Catalogue using `bcdata` and join to our existing `trees_dpg` geospatial dataset using the `st_join` function from the `sf` package. You can learn more about `sf` [here](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/).


```{r, cache = TRUE}
library(sf) #load the sf package

# Load the BEC data for Prince George Natural Resource District
bgc_dpg <- bcdc_query_geodata("WHSE_FOREST_VEGETATION.BEC_BIOGEOCLIMATIC_POLY") %>%
  filter(BBOX(dpg, crs = `EPSG:3005`)) %>% #note filtering with a BoundingBox
  collect()

# Join the BEC data with our tress_dpg geospatial data set
trees_bec_dpg <- trees_dpg %>% 
  st_join(bgc_dpg[, "MAP_LABEL"]) #join BEC data for each polygon
```

Now, we can summarize the area planted with western larch by biogeoclimatic unit:

```{r, warning = FALSE}
trees_bec_dpg %>% 
  group_by(MAP_LABEL) %>% # group polygons by biogeoclimatic unit
  summarise(Area = sum(FEATURE_AREA_SQM)/10000) %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = MAP_LABEL, y = Area) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(y = "Sum Treatment Unit Area (ha)",
       x = "Biogeoclimatic Unit",
       title = "Area Planted with Western Larch by Biogeoclimatic Unit\nin Prince George Natural Resource District",
       caption = paste0("Data sourced from the B.C. Data Catalogue\n on ",
                        Sys.Date(),
                        " using the bcdata R package")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```
