An R package üì¶ for searching & retrieving data from the [B.C. Data
Catalogue](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca).

  - `bcdc_browse()` - Open the catalogue in your default browser
  - `bcdc_search()` - Search records in the catalogue
  - `bcdc_search_facets()` - List catalogue facet search options
  - `bcdc_get_record()` - Print a catalogue record
  - `bcdc_tidy_resources()` - Get a data frame of resources for a record
  - `bcdc_get_data()` - Get catalogue data
  - `bcdc_query_geodata()` - Get & query catalogue geospatial data
    available through a [Web
    Service](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=95D78D544B244F34B89223EF069DF74E)

**Note:** The `bcdata` package supports downloading *most* file types,
including zip archives. It will do its best to identify and read data
from zip files, however if there are multiple data files in the zip, or
data files that `bcdata` doesn‚Äôt know how to import, it will fail. If
you encounter a file type in the B.C. Data Catalogue not currently
supported by `bcdata` please file an
[issue](https://github.com/bcgov/bcdata/issues/).
