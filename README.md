An R package üì¶ for searching & retrieving data from the [B.C. Data
Catalogue](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca).

- `bcdc_browse()` - Open the catalogue in your default browser
- `bcdc_search()` - Search records in the catalogue
- `bcdc_search_facets()` - List catalogue facet search options
- `bcdc_get_record()` - Print a catalogue record
- `bcdc_tidy_resources()` - Get a data frame of resources for a record
- `bcdc_get_data()` - Get catalogue data
- `bcdc_query_geodata()` - Get & query catalogue geospatial data
  available through a [Web Feature
  Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Feature_Service)

**Note:** The `bcdata` package supports downloading *most* file types,
including zip archives. It will do its best to identify and read data
from zip files, however if there are multiple data files in the zip, or
data files that `bcdata` doesn‚Äôt know how to import, it will fail. If
you encounter a file type in the B.C. Data Catalogue not currently
supported by `bcdata` please file an
[issue](https://github.com/bcgov/bcdata/issues/).

### Reference

[bcdata package üì¶ home page and reference
guide](https://bcgov.github.io/bcdata/)

### Installation

You can install `bcdata` directly from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=bcdata):

``` r
install.packages("bcdata")
```

To install the development version from GitHub, use the
[remotes](https://cran.r-project.org/package=remotes) package:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")

remotes::install_github("bcgov/bcdata")
library(bcdata)
```

### Vignettes

  bcdata](https://bcgov.github.io/bcdata/articles/bcdata.html)
- [Querying Spatial Data with
  bcdata](https://bcgov.github.io/bcdata/articles/efficiently-query-spatial-data-in-the-bc-data-catalogue.html)
- [Exploring Silviculture Data with

### Methods for `bcdc_promise`

The `bcdc_query_geodata()` returns an object of the class
`bcdc_promise`. We have written an ever growing list methods for this
class. You can use these methods directly on a object returned by
`bcdc_query_geodata()`. Here are all the methods for the `bcdc_promise`
class:

- `as_tibble`
- `collect`
- `filter`
- `head`
- `mutate`
- `names`
- `print`
- `select`
- `show_query`
- `tail`

### BCDC Authentication

If you are an authorized editor of the B.C. Data Catalogue you may want
to access records that are not publicly available (e.g., in DRAFT,
waiting to be published). This can be done by authenticating with the
catalogue with an API key.

***Important Note:*** *Your API key is like a password and you must take
care to keep it private. Do not share it, and be careful to not include
it in any scripts or accidentally commit it to GitHub.*

You can log in to the catalogue to obtain your API key, then store it as
an environment variable in your [`.Renviron`
file](https://rstats.wtf/r-startup.html#renviron). The environment
variable must be called `BCDC_KEY`, set like this:

    BCDC_KEY=your-api-key

This way, the relevant bcdata functions will read that key and use it to
authorize your calls to the catalogue, allowing you to access additional
records that you are authorized to see if you were logged into the
catalogue web interface. Functions that benefit from this are:

- `bcdc_search()`
- `bcdc_list()`
- `bcdc_get_record()`
- `bcdc_get_data()`
