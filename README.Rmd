An R package 📦 for searching & retrieving data from the [B.C. Data Catalogue]( https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca).

- `bcdc_browse()` - Open the catalogue in your default browser
- `bcdc_search()` - Search records in the catalogue
- `bcdc_search_facets()` - List catalogue facet search options
- `bcdc_get_record()` - Print a catalogue record
- `bcdc_tidy_resources()` - Get a data frame of resources for a record
- `bcdc_get_data()` - Get catalogue data
- `bcdc_query_geodata()` - Get & query catalogue geospatial data available through a [Web Service](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=95D78D544B244F34B89223EF069DF74E)

**Note:** The `bcdata` package supports downloading _most_ file types, including zip archives. It will do its best to identify and read data from
zip files, however if there are multiple data files in the zip, or data files that `bcdata` doesn't know how to import, it will fail. 
If you encounter a file type in the B.C. Data Catalogue not currently supported by `bcdata` please file an [issue](https://github.com/bcgov/bcdata/issues/).
