An R package 📦 for searching & retrieving data from the [B.C. Data Catalogue]( https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca).

- `bcdc_browse()` - Open the catalogue in your default browser
- `bcdc_search()` - Search records in the catalogue
- `bcdc_search_facets()` - List catalogue facet search options
- `bcdc_get_record()` - Print a catalogue record
- `bcdc_tidy_resources()` - Get a data frame of resources for a record
- `bcdc_get_data()` - Get catalogue data
- `bcdc_query_geodata()` - Get & query catalogue geospatial data available through a [Web Feature Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Feature_Service)

**Note:** The `bcdata` package supports downloading _most_ file types, including zip archives. It will do its best to identify and read data from
zip files, however if there are multiple data files in the zip, or data files that `bcdata` doesn't know how to import, it will fail. 
If you encounter a file type in the B.C. Data Catalogue not currently supported by `bcdata` please file an [issue](https://github.com/bcgov/bcdata/issues/). 

### Reference
[bcdata package 📦 home page and reference guide](https://bcgov.github.io/bcdata/)

### Installation
You can install `bcdata` directly from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=bcdata): 

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("bcdata")
```

To install the development version from GitHub, use the [remotes](https://cran.r-project.org/package=remotes) package:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")

remotes::install_github("bcgov/bcdata")
library(bcdata)
```


### Vignettes

- [Get Started with bcdata](https://bcgov.github.io/bcdata/articles/bcdata.html)
- [Querying Spatial Data with bcdata](https://bcgov.github.io/bcdata/articles/efficiently-query-spatial-data-in-the-bc-data-catalogue.html)
- [Exploring Silviculture Data with bcdata](https://bcgov.github.io/bcdata/articles/explore-silviculture-data-using-bcdata.html)

### Methods for `bcdc_promise`

The `bcdc_query_geodata()` returns an object of the class `bcdc_promise`. We have written an ever growing list methods for this class. You can use these methods directly on a object returned by `bcdc_query_geodata()`. Here are all the methods for the `bcdc_promise` class:

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
bcdc_methods <- methods(class = "bcdc_promise")
bcdc_methods <- sort(attributes(bcdc_methods)$info[,c("generic"), ])

cat(paste0("- `", bcdc_methods, "`", collapse = "\n"))
```


### BCDC Authentication

If you are an authorized editor of the B.C. Data Catalogue you may want to
access records that are not publicly available (e.g., in DRAFT, waiting to be
published). This can be done by authenticating with the catalogue with an API
key.

_**Important Note:**_ *Your API key is like a password and you must take care to
keep it private. Do not share it, and be careful to not include it in any
scripts or accidentally commit it to GitHub.*

You can log in to the catalogue to obtain your API key, then store it as an
environment variable in your [`.Renviron` file](https://rstats.wtf/r-startup.html#renviron). 
The environment variable must be called `BCDC_KEY`, set like this:

```
BCDC_KEY=your-api-key
```

This way, the relevant bcdata functions will read that key and use it to
authorize your calls to the catalogue, allowing you to access additional records
that you are authorized to see if you were logged into the catalogue web
interface. Functions that benefit from this are:

- `bcdc_search()`
- `bcdc_list()`
- `bcdc_get_record()`
- `bcdc_get_data()`
