\title{Provide a data frame containing the metadata for all resources from a single B.C. Data Catalogue record}
\usage{
bcdc_tidy_resources(record)
}
\arguments{
\item{record}{either a \code{bcdc_record} object (from the result of \code{bcdc_get_record()}),
a character string denoting the name or ID of a resource (or the URL) or a BC Geographic
Warehouse (BCGW) name.

It is advised to use the permanent ID for a record or the BCGW name rather than the
human-readable name to guard against future name changes of the record.
If you use the human-readable name a warning will be issued once per
session. You can silence these warnings altogether by setting an option:
\code{options("silence_named_get_data_warning" = TRUE)} - which you can set
in your .Rprofile file so the option persists across sessions.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the metadata for all the resources for a record
}
\description{
Returns a rectangular data frame of all resources contained within a record. This is particularly useful
if you are trying to construct a vector of multiple resources in a record. The data frame also provides
useful information on the formats, availability and types of data available.

airports <- bcdc_get_record("bc-airports")
