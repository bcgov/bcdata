\title{Describe the attributes of a Web Service feature}
\usage{
bcdc_describe_feature(record)
}
\arguments{
\item{record}{either a \code{bcdc_record} object (from the result of \code{bcdc_get_record()}),
a character string denoting the name or ID of a resource (or the URL) or a BC Geographic
Warehouse (BCGW) name.

It is advised to use the permanent ID for a record or the BCGW name rather than the
human-readable name to guard against future name changes of the record.
If you use the human-readable name a warning will be issued once per
session. You can silence these warnings altogether by setting an option:
\code{options("silence_named_get_data_warning" = TRUE)} - which you can set
in your .Rprofile file so the option persists across sessions.}
}
\value{
\code{bcdc_describe_features} returns a tibble describing the attributes of a B.C. Data Catalogue record.
The tibble returns the following columns:
\itemize{
\item col_name: attributes of the feature
\item sticky: whether a column can be separated from the record in a Web Service call via the \code{dplyr::select} method
\item remote_col_type: class of what is return by the web feature service
\item local_col_type: the column class in R
}
}
\description{
Describe the attributes of column of a record accessed through the Web Service.
This can be a useful tool to examine a layer before issuing a query with \code{bcdc_query_geodata}.
