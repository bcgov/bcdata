\title{Retrieve options used in bcdata, their value if set and
the default value.}
\usage{
bcdc_options()
}
\description{
This function retrieves bcdata specific options that
can be set. These options can be set using
\verb{option(\{name of the option\} = \{value of the option\})}.
The default options are purposefully set conservatively
to hopefully ensure successful requests. Resetting
these options may result in failed calls to the data
catalogue. Options in R are reset every time R is
re-started. See examples for addition ways to restore
your initial state.
}
\details{
\code{bcdata.max_geom_pred_size} is the maximum size of an
object used for a geometric operation. Objects that are
bigger than this value will have a bounding box drawn
and apply the geometric operation on that simpler
polygon. Users can try to increase the maximum
geometric predicate size and see if the bcdata
catalogue accepts their request.

\code{bcdata.chunk_limit} is an option useful when dealing
with very large data sets. When requesting large
objects from the catalogue, the request is broken up
into smaller chunks which are then recombined after
they've been downloaded. bcdata does this all for you
but using this option you can set the size of the chunk
requested. On faster internet connections, a bigger
chunk limit could be useful while on slower
connections, it is advisable to lower the chunk limit.
Chunks must be less than 10000.

\code{bcdata.cache_path} is the location on your computer
where results from web requests are cached. The default
is set by \code{\link[rappdirs:user_cache_dir]{rappdirs::user_cache_dir()}} via
\code{\link[=bcdc_cache_path]{bcdc_cache_path()}}. This option can only be set before
the package is loaded (e.g., by setting it in your
.Rprofile file).

\code{bcdata.cache_timeout} is the time, in seconds, that
the cache is maintained. Default is 3600 seconds (one
hour).  This option can only be set before the package
is loaded (e.g., by setting it in your .Rprofile file).
