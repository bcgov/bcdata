\title{Get preview map from the B.C. Web Map Service}
\usage{
bcdc_preview(record)
}
\arguments{
\item{record}{either a \code{bcdc_record} object (from the result of \code{bcdc_get_record()}),
a character string denoting the name or ID of a resource (or the URL) or a BC Geographic
Warehouse (BCGW) name.

It is advised to use the permanent ID for a record or the BCGW name rather than the
human-readable name to guard against future name changes of the record.
If you use the human-readable name a warning will be issued once per
session. You can silence these warnings altogether by setting an option:
\code{options("silence_named_get_data_warning" = TRUE)} - which you can set
in your .Rprofile file so the option persists across sessions.}
}
\description{
Note this does not return the actual map features, rather
