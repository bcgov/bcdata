# bcdata (development version)

### IMPROVEMENTS
* Geometry predicates can now take a `bbox` object as well as an `sf*` object (#176)
* Rename `selectable` column from `bcdc_describe_feature` to `sticky` and modify corresponding docs and tests (#180)
* Add `head` and `tail` methods for `bcdc.promise` objects. Thanks to @hgriesbauer for the suggestion! (#182, #186)
* Provide `as_tibble` as an alias for `collect` in line with `dbplyr` behaviour (#166)
* When reading in excel files, `bcdc_get_data` now outputs a messages indicating the presence and names of any sheets (#190)

### BUG FIXES
* Fix `select`, `filter` and `mutate` roxygen so that bcdata specific documentation to these methods is available

# bcdata 0.1.2

### IMPROVEMENTS
* Add `bcdc_tidy_resources` for retrieving a data frame containing the metadata for all resources from a single B.C. Data Catalogue record (PR#149, #147)
* Add a more decorative record print method  (#73)
* More reliable detection of layer name for a wfs call in `bcdc_query_geodata()` (#129, #138, #139)
* Add `mutate` method for bcdc_promise that only fails and suggest an alternative approach. (PR#134)
* Add back in querying vignette
* Using `tidyselect` so that `select.bcdc_promise` behaviour is typical of `dplyr::select` ($140, #138)
* Using GitHub actions for CI. 

### MINOR BREAKING CHANGES
* Remove `BEYOND()` and `RELATE()` geometry predicates as they are currently not fully supported by geoserver

* Fixed a bug where `DWITHIN` wasn't working because `units` needed to be unqoted (#154)
* Fixed a bug where `BBOX()` used in a `filter()` statement combined with `bcdc_query_geodata()` did not work (#135, #137, #131)
* Fixed a bug where layer names with a number in them would not work in `bcdc_query_geodata()` (#126, #127)
